So shaken as we are, so wan with care,

Find we a time for frighted peace to pant, 

And breathe short-winded aceent of new boils To be commenced in strands afar remote.

我是如此的疲惫，如此的烦恼，现在找一个喘息的时候吧，在喘息中我们且来商讨那将要在远方国土里掀起的新战争吧

No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;

Nor more shall trenching war channel her fiels, 

Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs

本国土地的裂罅以后不再用本国子孙的血涂染她的嘴唇了；战争不再在本国土地上刻划壕沟了，也不再用敌骑的铁蹄来践踏她的花草了

Of hostile paecs:those opposed eyes,

Which, like the meteors of a trouble heaven,

All of one nature, of one substance bred,

Did lately meet in the intestine shock

And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,

March all one way and be no more opposed

Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:

The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,

No more shall cut his master. 

本是同根同种，而近来竟瞪起仇恨的眼睛，像是雷雨中的电闪一般，从事内战，互相残杀，此后要齐一步伍，在一条路上前进，不可再在亲族友好之间互相敌视;战争的锋芒，像是没有套好鞘的利刃，不可再伤害自家人。

Therefore, friends,

As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross

We are impressed and engaged to fight,

Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;

Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb

To chase these pagans in those holy fields

Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet

Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd

For our advantage on the bitter cross.

所以，朋友们，远至基督的坟墓，——我们现在就是基督的战士，就是在他的十字架下被募集去赴战的，——我们要募集一队英吉利的大军，他们的胳臂是在娘胎里就已锻炼好，专为驱逐那些异教徒们，从那一千四百年前为我们死在十字架上的那人圣足所曾履践的土地上驱赶出去。

But this our purpose now is twelve month old,

And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:

Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear

Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,

What yesternight our council did decree

In forwarding this dear expedience.

这原是我一年前的打算，用不着再告诉你们我是愿意去的。我们不是为了这事才来开会的。那么你告诉我，我的好兄弟威斯摩兰，为了促进这回重要的急事，枢密院昨晚有什么决定。

----------
### WESTMORELAND  ###
My liege, this haste was hot in question,

And many limits of the charge set down

But yesternight: when all athwart there came

A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;

Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,

Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight

Against the irregular and wild Glendower,

Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,

A thousand of his people butchered;

Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,

Such beastly shameless transformation,

By those Welshwomen done as may not be

Without much shame retold or spoken of.

陛下，这紧急的事曾经热烈研讨。昨晚颁发了许多命令给各将领；不料这时节从威尔斯来了探报，带着噩耗；最坏的是，高贵的毛提摩，率领着海福县的人马去征讨那狂悖不法的格兰道渥，竟被这威尔斯人生擒了去，部众一千人都被杀戮了；威尔斯女人对这些尸体还加以摧残，其惨无人道，说起来都不能不觉得耻辱。

### KING HENRY IV  ###
It seems then that the tidings of this broil

Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

这战事的消息似乎是阻扰了我们到圣地去的计划了。
